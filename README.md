# oci-terraform-generator
Oracle Cloud Generator takes as input a bunch of terraform templates - written with Jinja2 -, a single YAML input file and generates usable terraform files.  

# Limitations
Current releases and master branch are compatible with terraform >=0.12.
Releases v1.0 and v1.1 are compatible only with terraform <= v0.11.
